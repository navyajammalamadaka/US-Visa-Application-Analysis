# US-Visa-Application-Analysis

As part of the project, we analysed the US Visa applications across the globe and present a study about insights received. The implementation details are carried out to analyze the trend in US visa applications throughout the world. The document describes the problem statement, approach, analysis, and proposed scalable architecture. The code and graphical representation of the analysis have been explained in detail for the reader’s clarity.

#Problem Statement and Objectives

An unimaginable amount of people applies for US visas every year. The amount of data gathered
and information available to process is immense, wherein the processed data can have several use
cases.
A permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to
hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States. In most instances, before the U.S.
employer can submit an immigration petition to the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the employer must obtain a certified labor certification
application from the DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA). The DOL must certify
to the USCIS that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept
the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker
will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.
Inspired by this scenario, we intend to create an analysis to answer
1. Prediction of visa decisions based on employee/employer/wage
2. Which countries have the highest number of Visa Applications?
3. Which destination states have attracted the majority of visa applicants in the US?
4. Which destination cities have attracted the majority of visa applicants in the US?
5. What do the number of applications per month look like?
6. How have the number of US visa applications changed over the years?
7. What is the change in number of distinct visa case statuses over the years?
8. F1 visa acceptance and rejection analysis
